# Conure

Conure is a Firefox web extension that intercepts calls to a web API in order to learn from its responses and ultimately fake them.

## Get started

Install the dependencies.

```bash
yarn
```

Adjust the web-ext.config.js to point to your firefox binary.

Then start in test browser:

```bash
yarn build
yarn start
```

A browser window will open automatically with the web-extension loaded.
